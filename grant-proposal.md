## Elevator Pitch
PINESCRIPERS is a decentralized marketplace and builder platform for scalping and trading strategies. Users can buy, sell, or request Pine Script-based strategies with gated delivery, blind uploads, and verified ownership. Our platform is built to scale â€” empowering both coders and traders through trustless strategy monetization.

## Problem
Thereâ€™s no transparent way for creators to securely publish and monetize Pine Script strategies. Public uploads are easily copied, and there's no standard marketplace with security, access gating, or on-chain licensing.

## Solution
PINESCRIPERS enables a verified, role-based experience:
- Buyers can access QR-based purchases and time-limited sessions.
- Builders (pro users) can upload strategies to the marketplace with wallet-verified authorship.
- Admins can approve requests and control delivery securely.

## What Weâ€™ve Built
- Full marketplace & builder platform (React + Supabase)
- Role-based dashboards for free/pro users
- Checkout with QR, timer, auto-expiry
- Admin panel with approvals, download access
- Referral system & wallet binding
- Deployment: https://pinescripers.vercel.app
